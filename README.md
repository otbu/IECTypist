**IECTypist**

What is it: _IECTypist_ is a utility for parsing/converting IEC 61131-3 DUT (Data Unit Type) definitions. This is quite a special use case really, I doubt if you will ever need it.

Supported TYPE...END_TYPE bodies is currently limited to:
* linear data structure (STRUCT) definitions 100% compatible with C and an accompanying C header (iec_typist_struct.h).
 
Supported dialects is limited to:
* Beckhoff TwinCAT *.TcDUT files (XML based).
